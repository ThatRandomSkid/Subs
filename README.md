# Subs
Simple API interface to find a YouTube user's subscription

Only works if the user has made their subscriptions public, which is off by default for newer accounts but on for many older ones.


To use:
1. Download and navigate to file location
2. Replace the API key placeholder with your own Google Cloud YouTube Data API v3 API key
3. Run in bash (replace USER with target username):
   './sh "USER"'

Optional: Add 'adv' after to get the description of the subscribed channels and when the user subscripbed.
